This VueJS project is designed to help users master new skills efficiently. It revolves around the concept of dedicating a set number of hours, for instance, 20 hours, to actively learn a specific skill. This could range from gaining a general understanding of a topic like Java to mastering a specific aspect of it.

What I have/want to achieve in this project.

- Users input the skill they want to learn and the time they believe it will take to learn it thoroughly (e.g., 20 hours).

- A timer is used to track active learning sessions. Users start and stop the timer during each study period, aiming to reach their total committed hours.

- Based on Josh Kaufman's methodology, the program divides the total learning hours into different stages, such as spending the first 5 hours on an overview before moving to in-depth study.

- Upon completing the learning hours, users can rate their satisfaction with their newfound skills. Low ratings prompt the program to suggest additional learning time for similar future skills and provide links to effective learning resources.

- Users earn trophies for each skill they master.

- A resource page offers courses and materials for effective skill acquisition.

- Features include account creation, login/logout functionality, and potential integration with Google/Facebook for authentication.
